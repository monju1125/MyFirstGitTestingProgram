Problem Statement:

Part 1: For Loops
1. In your main method create an array to represent the GPAs of students in a Java course. Create another array to represent the GPAs of students in a Python course. 
2. Create a method that takes an array of GPAs and returns an integer that represents the number of GPAs that were 3.5 or above.
Example input: {2.4, 3.4, 2.3, 3.8, 4.0, 3.5}
Output: 3
3. In main(), invoke the method by passing the array of Java course GPAs and then invoke the method again and pass the Python course GPAs.
 
Part 2: While loops
In Java, we can generate a random number between 0 and 10 by running the following:
int num = (int) Math.floor(Math.random()*11);
 
In main() create the variable int num and assign it the value of 0. Next, create a while loop that continues as long as num is not equal to 7. Inside the while loop, add the above line to randomly generate the value of num. On the next line (still within the while loop) print the value of num.
